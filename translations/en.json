It downloads and scans course content, finds common accessibility barriers, and provides tools and suggestions for removing them. UDOIT integrates directly with Learning Management Systems so that scanning information is always up-to-date and that fixes made with UDOIT are instantly saved to your online course.</p>",
  "settings.text.tools": "<h2>Scanning Toolkit</h2><p>UDOIT uses the open source <a href='https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/' target='_blank'>IBM Equal Access Checker</a> to scan and identify accessibility barriers. This checker finds most, but not all, accessibility barriers, and is incredibly consistent according to <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/implementations/equal-access/' target='_blank'>public performance data</a>. While it allows for many configurations, UDOIT scans with the ruleset for WCAG 2.1 AA, which is the <a href='https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/#highlights-of-the-requirements-in-the-rule' target='_blank'>legal requirement for state and government institutions</a> under the new rule for the Americans with Disabilities Act.",
