When users reach elements by tabbing with the keyboard, the element's role provides context about the expected interaction, and assistive technologies like screen readers can provide additional information about ways to interact. The only elements that should be in the tab order should be operable widgets. Inoperable elements, such as headings, can be given focus by developers; however, they should not be tabbable by the user.</p><p>It's likely that either a non-interactive element was given a <code>tabindex</code> value of 0 or greater, or assigned an element’s role incorrectly. The Checker detects implied roles of interactive HTML elements that automatically get keyboard focus. The Checker also detects content blocks that get keyboard focus to enable scrolling of the area using arrow keys when coding CSS <code>overflow: scroll</code> or <code>overflow: auto</code>. Both of these situations are valid. However, if the element <em>should not</em> be operable with the keyboard, then it <em>should not</em> be tabbable and get keyboard focus.</p><p>Note: IBM considers this a <em>violation</em> of WCAG Success Criteria. Others may use a strict interpretation of the criterion and may only <em>recommend</em> this to be fixed. However, there is broad agreement that putting inoperable elements in the tab order has an accessibility impact on users.</p><p>Error: <a href=\"https://unpkg.com/accessibility-checker-engine@3.1.73/help/en-US/element_tabbable_role_valid.html#%7B%22message%22%3A%22The%20tabbable%20element's%20role%20'%7B0%7D'%20is%20not%20a%20widget%20role%22%2C%22msgArgs%22%3A%5B%22%7B0%7D%22%2C%22%7B1%7D%22%2C%22%7B3%7D%22%2C%22%7B4%7D%22%5D%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22RECOMMENDATION%22%2C%22FAIL%22%5D%2C%22reasonId%22%3A%22fail_invalid_role%22%7D\">The tabbable element's role '{0}' is not a widget role</a></p><p>!important: Needs an example error.</p><h2>RuleId: frame_title_exists (VIOLATION)</h2><p>Description: <span>An inline frame’s title provides a label for the frame that describes its content to the user.
