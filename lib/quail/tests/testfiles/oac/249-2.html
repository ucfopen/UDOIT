<p>The following is an excerpt from the <cite>The Story of my Life</cite> by Helen Keller</p>
 <blockquote>
 <p>Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood
 hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the first violets and lilies.  
 There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face 
 in the cool leaves and grass.</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>Helen Keller said, <q>Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, 
we can never do anything good in the world.</q></p>
