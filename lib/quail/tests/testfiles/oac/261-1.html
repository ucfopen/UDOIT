How to Meet Success Criterion 2.4.1 <br/>

<strong>User Agent and Assistive Technology Support Notes</strong><br/>
Home Page Reader, JAWS, and WindowEyes all provide navigation via headings and provide information about the level of the heading. The Opera browser provides a mechanism to navigate by headings. Additional plugins support navigation by headings in other user agents.<br/>

<strong>Description</strong><br/>
The objective of this technique is to demonstrate how using the heading elements, h and h1 - h6, to markup the beginning of each section in the content can assist in navigation. Most assistive technologies and many user agents provide a mechanism to navigate by heading elements by providing keyboard commands that allow users to jump from one heading to the next. Using heading elements to markup sections of a document allows users to easily navigate from section to section.<br/>
