<p>The following is an excerpt from the The Story of my Life by Helen Keller</p>

 <p>Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood
 hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the first violets and lilies.  
 There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face 
 in the cool leaves and grass.</p>


<p>Helen Keller said, Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, 
we can never do anything good in the world.</p>
